# PassphrasePolicy
C# Console app that checks passwords from a specified blacklist .txt file against a predetermined set of rules as specified by a password policy.

NOTE: The original code used a directory "PasswordLists", which contained an output file for writing a report with summary stats (report.txt), as well as a large master password list (google rockyou.txt password list). I'm working on making some changes around this. The directory is not present currently.
